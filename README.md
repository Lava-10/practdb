# PractDb

PractDb is a lightweight, educational database system designed for learning and experimentation. The implementation draws inspiration from several key resources:

# Compilation

To get started, install `rustup` (if you don't already have it) and then install the **nightly toolchain** by running `rustup toolchain install nightly`; next, compile the project with `cargo +nightly build`â€”alternatively, to avoid specifying `+nightly` for every Cargo command, set your default toolchain to nightly using `rustup default nightly`; if you encounter any compilation errors, check your compiler version by running `rustc +nightly --version` and comparing it to the expected version (e.g., **`rustc 1.78.0-nightly`**

# Tests

Use [`cargo test`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-test.html) to
run all the unit tests:

```bash
cargo +nightly test
```

## Unsafe

All the [unsafe](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html) code
is located in [`./src/storage/page.rs`](./src/paging/page.rs), which is the
module that implements slotted pages. [`Miri`](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri)
can be used to test possible undefined behaviour bugs. Install the component
using `rustup`:

```bash
rustup +nightly component add miri
```

Then use `cargo` to test the `page` module:

```bash
cargo +nightly miri test storage::page::tests
```

The [`./src/paging/`](./src/paging/) and
[`./src/storage/btree.rs`](./src/storage/btree.rs) modules are not unsafe
themselves but they heavily rely on the slotted page module so it's worth
testing them with Miri as well:

```bash
cargo +nightly miri test paging
cargo +nightly miri test storage::btree
```

If all these modules work correctly without UB then the rest of the codebase
should be fine. The ultimate UB test is the [`./src/db.rs`](./src/db.rs) module
since it's the entry point to SQL execution so it makes use of every other
module. It can be tested with Miri as well since tests are configured to run
completely in memory without files or system calls:

```bash
cargo +nightly miri test db::tests
```

The rest of modules don't make any use of unsafe code so it's not necessary to
test them with Miri.

# Running The Program

Use this command to start the TCP server on port `8000` (the default if not
specified):

```bash
cargo +nightly run -- file.db 8000
```

`file.db` can be any empty file or a file previously
managed by `practDb`. It works like SQLite in that regard, the difference is that
in order to use `practDb` you have to connect to the server with some TCP client
that implements the network protocol described at
[`./src/tcp/proto.rs`](./src/tcp/proto.rs). The [`./client`](`./client`) package
is a console client similar to that of MySQL or any other database and can be
used like this:

```bash
cargo +nightly run --package client -- 8000
```

This will connect to the `practDb` server running on port `8000` and provide you with
a shell where you can type SQL and see the results of the queries.
